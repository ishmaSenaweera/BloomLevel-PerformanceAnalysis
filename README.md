# Predicting and Assessing Student Performance Repository

Welcome to the Predicting and Assessing Student Performance repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for datasets related to our innovative study on predicting and assessing student performance using a combination of Bloom's Taxonomy levels and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique. Our research delves into the intricate relationship between cognitive complexity and academic performance in an educational context.

## Key Dataset Types

### Bloom's Level-wise Marks

A dataset that provides detailed insights into student performance based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels. It offers a granular view of how students fare on assessments of varying cognitive complexity.

### Overall Marks

A dataset that presents overall marks achieved by students, offering a broader perspective on their performance without considering Bloom's Taxonomy levels.

## Usage

You can use these datasets for various educational research purposes, including but not limited to:

- Analyzing the relationship between Bloom's Taxonomy levels and student performance.
- Developing predictive models to assess and improve student outcomes.
- Investigating cognitive complexity and its impact on academic achievements.

Happy researching!
