# BloomLevel-PerformanceAnalysis
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for datasets related to the innovative study on predicting and assessing student performance using a combination of Bloom's Taxonomy levels and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique. Our research delves into the intricate relationship between cognitive complexity and academic performance in an educational context.

Key Dataset Types:

Bloom's Level-wise Marks: Explore datasets that provide detailed insights into student performance based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels. These datasets offer a granular view of how students fare on assessments of varying cognitive complexity.

Overall Marks: Additionally, we provide datasets that present overall marks achieved by students, offering a broader perspective on their performance without considering Bloom's Taxonomy levels.
